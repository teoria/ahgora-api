# Ahgora API
Simple php api to communicate with the [Ahgora](https://www.ahgora.com.br/) system.

# Install
`composer require williamokano/ahgora-api`

# Requirements
PHP 5.6+
Should work with PHP 5.5, but this API is as-is, so I don't guarantee anything.

# Contributing
Just make a pull request. Please follow all the non-deprecated psr's.
The build should be passing, should have tests, and should be following the styleCI standards.
